	<h1>Welcome to W3b Dojo!</h1>
	<p>
		This is a set of tutorials meant for both total beginners and intermediate developers. It is
		meant to be a comprehensive guide to web accessibility.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each lesson will be composed of a reading section with interactive widgets and code examples,
		and a quiz section. The lessons don't build on one another, so you can choose lessons in any
		order.
