	<h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl">What is it?</h2>
	<p class="mt-2">
		This is a set of tutorials meant for both total beginners, and intermediate developers. It is
		meant to be a comprehensive guide to web accessibility.
	</p>
	<h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl">How does it work?</h2>
	<p class="mt-2">
		Each lesson will be composed of reading sections, interactive widgets, code examples, and at the
		end a quiz section. The lessons don't build on one another. So you can choose lessons in any
		order.
